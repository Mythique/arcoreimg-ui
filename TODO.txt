This is some of the things I had in mind to improve this app. I currently don't plan to work on this soon, but we never know.

- Reduce memory footprint (convert images to a smaller one ? what is the cost of downsampling?).
- Add evaluation items one at a time? Instead of all of them at the end.

- Add the time an image was evaluated, could be useful to make a comparison with a newer version of the same image?

- Do we really need to display the size of an image? use case?

- Add a "remove from list" button :
	- Individual button for an image.
	- "clear all" button.

- Add an option to override an existing image (preventing duplicates).
	- This option could also compare the new score to the previous score.

- Add sort option ?
	- time
	- score
	- name

- Multiplatform with .NET Core and Avalon? => Might be too complicated and add too much dependencies...
